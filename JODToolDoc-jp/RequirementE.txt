The plant is equipped with sensors that are able to raise alarms in response to conditions in the plant.
When an alarm is raised, an expert must be called to the scene.
Experts have different qualifications for coping with different kinds of alarms.
It has been decided to produce a model to ensure that the rulues concerning the duty schedule and the calling out of experts are correctly understood and implemented.
The individual requirements are laelled R1, R8 for further reference.

R1. A computer-based system is to be developed to manage the alarms of this plant.
R2. Four kinds of qualifications are needed to cope with the alarms: electrical, mechanical, biological,and chemical.
R3. There must be experts on duty during all periods allocated in the system.
R4. Each expert can have a list of qualifications.
R5. Each alarm reported to the system has a qualification associated with it along with a description of the alarm that can be understood by the expert.
R6. Whenever an alarm is received by the system an expert with the right qualification should be found so that he or she can be paged.
R7. The experts should	 be able to use the system database to check when they will be on duty.
